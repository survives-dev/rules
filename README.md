## Branch name conventions

Must be `Category: Edit Content`
Categories are as follows

- `feature`: completely new code or new features
- `fix`: changes that fix bugs (include details if possible)
- `issues`: can be a feature, but can also be in a format like `issues/#1`.

More to be added in the future
